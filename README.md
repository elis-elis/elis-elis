## Hello there. thanks for checking out my page.

I am Elis. I am new in the programing environment but I feel that this 'stuff' belong in me. 

Iâ€™m currently studying Sofware engeneering at MasterSchool. and I am doing pretty well ;) 

It would be lovely to collaborate on some projects and learn together in the futuure or even now.
I am planning to concentrate of frontend development, although at the moment I am still working with python mostly.
