<h1 align="right">Salut, dear(s).  <br /> 
  I am 'e.' <br />
</a> 
but you can call me Elis ;)</h1>

My transition into technology was driven by curiosity and a desire to expand my artistic practice. After years of working with digital art, collage, performance art, I sought a new tool and perspective, which led me to apply to the Masterschool software engineering bootcamp. <br />
As I explored programming, I noticed parallels between coding and collage-making â€” both involve structuring, layering, and assembling elements to create something meaningful. <br />
Although I had to shift my thinking to understand programming, I found a deep connection between art and technology, which now motivates me to continue growing in this field. <br />
It would be lovely to collaborate on some projects and learn together in the future or even now. <br />
